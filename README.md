### ⚠️ **Note on GitHub Pages**

➡ **GitHub Pages only hosts static sites (HTML, CSS, JS).**  
Laravel is a **backend PHP framework**, so it requires a server (VPS, cPanel, or Laravel Forge) to run.

✅ **What to do instead?**

- Deploy Laravel apps on:
  - **Heroku** (free limited plans)
  - **Railway.app**
  - **Render.com**
  - **DigitalOcean (VPS)**
  - **Laravel Forge (paid)**
